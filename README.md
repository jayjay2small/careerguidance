## 📘 What Is careerguidance?

careerguidance is a simple tool that helps students find suitable career paths. It uses AI to look at your grades, skills, and certifications. Then, it suggests careers and internships that match. This way, you get advice based on your own information, not just general tips.

The app works by taking your academic results and skills through a mobile app. Then, it sends the data to an online service that uses a smart model to recommend careers. This helps you focus your efforts on fields where you have the best chance to succeed.

## 🔍 How It Works

The app uses a machine learning model called Random Forest Classifier. Here’s how it processes your info:

1. You enter your grades, skills, and other details.
2. The app sends this data to a service hosted on Render (an online platform).
3. The AI model evaluates your info and predicts which career fields suit you best.
4. It recommends related internships and certification programs to boost your chances.

Behind the scenes, the system cleans your input data, encodes categories for the model, balances any uneven data amounts to avoid bias, and splits data fairly to keep results reliable.
