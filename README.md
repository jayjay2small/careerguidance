🎯 AI-Based Career Guidance & Recommendation System:
An AI-driven career guidance system that predicts suitable career domains for students based on their academic performance, skills, and certifications, and recommends relevant internships and certifications to enhance employability.

📌 Project Objective:
To provide data-driven, personalized career guidance for students by using machine learning instead of generic career advice.

🧠 Machine Learning Model:
Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
Task: Multi-class career domain classification
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

🛠️ Data Preprocessing Techniques:
Data cleaning using Pandas
Label Encoding for target variable
One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
RandomOverSampler to handle class imbalance
Stratified Train-Test Split for fair evaluation

🔄 System Workflow:
1. Student inputs academic and skill details in the mobile app.
2. Data is sent to the Flask API hosted on Render.
3. The Random Forest model predicts the suitable career domain.
4. Based on prediction, the system recommends internships and certifications.
5. Results are displayed in the Flutter mobile application.
